# Feedback

- Report mAP on train data -> configuration option in main.py
- Features: n-gramms of POS and lemma
- BERT: integrate topic and stance as text
- Look at model "failures": What key points are classified wrong?
- Combine:
  - Tune rule-based on precision, Tune NN on "rest"
  - Train one model on negative stance, one on positive stance
  - Cascading classifiers: Train more complex models at end
- Multi-step finetuning (maybe)
  - As in: https://aclweb.org/anthology/2020.semeval-1.44/
  - Tune for stance classification first
  - Tune for key point matching second
